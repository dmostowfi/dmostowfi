# Hi there! I'm Deanna :wave:

While working as a product manager, my favorite part of the role was writing specs, because doing so represented the culmination of a satisfying process: identifying a pain point and turning user stories into a new feature idea. I vividly recall one instance (which I'm sure many PMs can relate to) where I thought I had come up with an "easy" solution to an unmet user need, until my eng counterpart gave me the timeline: 4 weeks. "Four weeks?!" I thought, but the truth is I had no clue the complexity of what I was asking.     

The experience motivated me to enroll in undergraduate computer science classes through Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, on top of the 2 master's degrees I was already pursuing. What started as a desire to speak engineering language turned into a real passion to own the full product lifecycle

## My Superpowers

### 1. User-Centered and Software-Minded
a
Built experiences, always stopping short of the solution

### 2. Bridging the gap between engineering, design, and product
I've worked on multi-disciplinary teams throughout my career, and let's be honest,. The source of all friction is lack of understanding, but when these disciplines come together, magical things happen.

### 3. Self-Driven, Self-Learner
Lorem
