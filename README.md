# Hi there! I'm Deanna :wave:

Why am I here? A brief, yet extremely common, interaction for the tech world pretty much sums it up...

While working as a product manager, I vividly recall one instance where I thought I had come up with an "easy" solution to an unmet user need, until my eng counterpart gave me a timeline far longer than I expected (sounds familiar yet?). "How is that possible!?", I thought. But the truth is (time to be vulnerable), I. had. no. clue. about the complexity of what I was asking.     

The experience, which left me feeling in the dark, motivated me to enroll in undergraduate computer science classes through Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, on top of the 2 master's degrees I was already pursuing. What started as a desire to speak engineering language turned into a real passion to own the full product lifecycle. 

#### tl;dr Designing the user experience is no longer enough for me. I want to build it too.

## My Superpowers

### 1. User-Centered and Software-Minded
I'm an experience designer by trade, and identifying user needs and defining innovative solutions has been my bread and butter throughout my career. But building software systems is about making tradeoffs, so when I'm owning the entire product lifecycle, my goal is to make tradeoffs that optimize both user experience and program efficiency.   

### 2. Bridging the gap between engineering, design, and product
Every one of my teams has been cross-functional, and whether in tech or non-tech industries, a common thread remains: the source of all friction is lack of understanding. My journey to software engineering began because I wanted to enhance my understanding, but now, I wear all hats. Bridging the gap is extremely important to me because I've experienced firsthand how when different functions come together, magical things will happen.
